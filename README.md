# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

<!-- challenge

Create a system for a small virtual store, the owner wants to save the information of his product suppliers, each product will have only one supplier, he also wants to save the information of each order, which can contain several products in the same order. In order to carry out his marketing campaigns in the future, he also wants to store information from customers who have already placed orders in his virtual store. He would also like to know which products are most present in orders, that is, list the orders in which each product is present.

Technical requirements: the system must be created using the MERN stack (Mongo, Express, React and Node), the source code stored on Github with information on how the system should be executed: commands, etc. For each table created in the generated data model, all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete) must be available in the system. Both the backend and frontend must validate the information entered by the user. The entire code implementation must be in English, but the frontend must show in Portuguese. -->
